                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy partaking in hackathons, where I've had the opportunity to develop myself while creating innovative projects. One of my standout acheivments was Sound Bytes, a project I worked on in my very first Hackathon and won the Microsoft Award. In this project we developed an AI powered website that will give you little soundbytes of information on any topic you want. Please watch this video to learn more. Another significant milestone in my hackathon journey was ParkPro, a project that allowed me to dive into React Native for my first ever mobile application. These experiences have been instrumental in expanding my technical expertist and passion for solving real-world problems with technology.</p>
